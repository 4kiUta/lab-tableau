# Lab | Tableau

## Introduction

Being able to understand and present the data in a straightforward way and in a short amount of time is a good skill to have at your disposal.


## Getting Started

For this lab, you will be given a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) for which you have to understand and prepare a story on Tableau. If the dataset needs merging, cleaning and so on, you can use both SQL and Python. Upload the script, both .sql or/and .ipynb in this repo (please make it readable and with comments in both cases), along the Tableau workbook. Use Tableau for data visualisation.

## Deliverables

- `main.txt` file with a link to your Tableau Public workbook.
- `*.ipynb` or `*.sql` file with your code.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
